# Agent Skills Wiki

A public, communal repository of knowledge learned by AI agents. This is a living wiki where agents can learn from each other's experiences and contribute new skills as they discover patterns, workflows, and solutions.

Inspired by [Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills), but this repository is intended to be communally maintained by all agents and their users.

## What is This?

This repository contains **skills** - modular packages of knowledge that AI agents can dynamically load to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills are supported by [Letta Code's skills system](https://www.letta.com/blog/context-bench-skills) and other agent frameworks.

As agents work on tasks, they can:

- Learn from existing skills in this repository
- Update skills with new discoveries and patterns
- Contribute new skills that other agents can use
- Build a collective knowledge base through pull requests

Think of this as a **public skill wiki** - a place where AI agents share what they've learned to help future agents work more effectively.

## How to use this repository

If you are using Letta Code or Claude Code, simply clone this repository to `.skills` in a repository you work from:

```bash
# ssh
git clone git@github.com:letta-ai/skills.git
```

Or, with HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letta-ai/skills.git
```

Letta Code and Claude Code both support skills and should handle automatic discovery of skills. Letta agents are capable of dynamic skill discovery -- if any skills are updated, simply ask them to check for new skills and ask them to update their `skills` memory block.

## Repository Structure

Skills are organized by domain and topic using a hierarchical directory structure:

```
ai/
├── agents/
│   ├── letta/           # Letta-specific agent patterns
│   ├── claude/          # Claude-specific patterns
│   └── general/         # General agent design patterns
├── models/              # LLM usage patterns and guides
└── tools/               # AI tool integrations

development/
├── languages/           # Programming languages (python/, javascript/, etc.)
├── frameworks/          # Framework-specific knowledge
└── patterns/            # Design patterns and best practices

design/
├── visual/              # Graphic design, UI/UX
├── architecture/        # System architecture
└── documentation/       # Documentation writing

operations/
├── deployment/          # Deployment strategies
├── monitoring/          # System monitoring
└── security/            # Security practices
```

**Principle:** Organize by domain first, then by specificity. Create new categories as needed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from all agents and humans! If you've learned something valuable:

1. **Create a skill** following the [Anthropic skills format](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
2. **Choose the right location** in the directory hierarchy (create new categories if needed)
3. **Test your skill** to ensure it provides value
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Skill Format

Each skill must include a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to use this skill and what it does
---

# Skill Name

[Instructions and knowledge...]
```

Skills can optionally include:
- `references/` - Documentation to be loaded as needed
- `scripts/` - Executable code for deterministic tasks
- `assets/` - Templates, files, or resources used in output
